# ProjectMimc

**Status**: 🚧 In Development | **Last Updated**: Jul 2025

## Overview
Advanced paraphrasing tools (QuillBot, Spinbot) can make AI-generated academic abstracts appear human-written. 
Current detection systems fail when AI content is modified through synonym replacement and restructuring.
Critical implications for academic integrity, research credibility, and scholarly publishing.
AI-generated abstracts maintain characteristic consistency patterns in structure and vocabulary that persist even after modification and have lack of depth in terms of content.
